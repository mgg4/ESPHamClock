# ESPHamClock

This is a snapshot of the latest source distribution from Clear Sky Institute.

With the passing of Elwood Downey (WB0OEW) it was important to capture this version 
right away.  This ensures a stable checkpoint from which any future development can
take place.

## Process

Here is what I did to create this clean repo.

1. Located and downloaded a copy of the 4.22 version of the ESPHamClock.zip file.
	* This file was located in the FreeBSD distribution repository.
2. Validated that this file matched the checksum and expected size as stated in 
the FreeBSD repository.
3. Expanded the zip file.
4. Renamed the resulting 'ESPHamClock' directory to 'src'.
5. Created and populated the ARTIFACTS directory to document the starting state
of the repository as the final state of the source distribution from Clear Sky
Institute.
6. Created this README.md.

I do not claim ownership of this software.  The sole intent of this repository is
to establish a point in time for the source code, preserving the final state of
ESPHamClock, and to act as a baseline for any future development that might take
place.  Refer to the [PROVENANCE.md](ARTIFACTS/PROVENANCE.md) file for more
information regarding this repository.
